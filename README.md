# Connect 4 Personal Project

This is my first game I have made with C++. It has been a learning experience that has taught me a lot about the language, but also about how to create a game.
I decided to create this simple concept of a game to build upon previous knowledge and extend my skills further using the standard library, C++ concepts such as references and pointers.
In reflection after finishing this project, I have decided to leave it as is. It has served its purpose of teaching me new skills and pushing myself into completing a project where I am satisfied.

My feedback for myself is that a lot of the logic can be refactored, however at this stage I don't have the understanding to make it more efficient at my current skill level.
In retrospect, using a 1d vector and traversing through the elements would be faster, as well as a little bit easier when using iterators to traverse diagonolly, but I found using the [] operator was much more intuitive
in a 2d vector.
